        <h1>Ryan Bush</h1>
        <p>
			Hello, my name is Ryan Bush and I am a student at UGA. I was born in Thomasville, GA on 
			September 12, 1996. I grew up in Thomasville, but moved to Pelham when I was 15 which is only 
			about 20 minutes away. Not many people know about Thomasville or Pelham, they are just small towns
			in South Georgia with absolutely nothing to do, but count the days as they go by. Coming to Athens, GA 
			was not a tough transition, but was something I had never experienced and was more eager than I have ever
			been to embark on starting somewhere totally different. Athens is by no means a large city but 
			when you come from a town that has two stop lights and if you blink about four times you are
			already out of the city limits, it is quite the change. Especially if the change is graduating
			from a high school with only 500 people, and most of my lecture classes have 300 people 
			which is two times the size of my graduating class. With the University of Georgia having 
			roughly 35,000 students and Thomasville’s entire city population being about 18,000. Pelham’s 
			population is only 3,841. I am thankful though for getting to experience such a great
			university and change in my life.
